## Instructions
This is the secound project covered in the Udacity Nanodegree "Front End Developer".
We had to use Javascript to give the page some functionality, so only the *js/app.js* is edited.
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.

## How to run
Fork your own version and just fire up the *index.html*.
